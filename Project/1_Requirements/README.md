## Introduction
In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faraheite”.And used the SimuleIDE Software


# **Features:**
 
- Low Cost 
- Checks if the driver is seated or not.
- Can modify the temperature according to the passenger.
- Robust System

## Details requirements
### High Level Requirements:
| ID | Description | 
|----| ------------| 
|HLR1  | When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater. | 
|HLR2  | Analog input from the temperature sensor | 
|HLR3  | Display. |		

#### Low Level Requirements:

| ID | Description |
|-------|------|
| LLR1 | ADC with Pulse Width Modulation.| 
| LLR2 | Compatible on different Operating Systems. |
